    <h1>Hello there.</h1>
    <br />
    <p>This is the landing page for the Valour Media Proxy Server. You probably 
    have no clue what that means, so I'll help a little. Valour can't send images 
    and files directly from one user to another - because safety reasons - so this server 
    acts as a middleman and ensure that your content is sent safely and quickly.</p>
    <br />
    <p>How does this work? Put simply, we use hashes of messages linked to the resulting 
    url stored in a database to quickly find what goes where. For some trusted sources, this 
    system may be bypassed entirely. For file uploads, we do additional work to store and secure 
    your content. If our local storage fills up, your content is seamlessly shifted to the cloud.</p>

    <p>Thanks for checking it out - Spike</p>
